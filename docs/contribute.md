# Contributing to LibreTime

First and foremost, thank you! We appreciate that you want to contribute to
LibreTime, your time is valuable, and your contributions mean a lot to us.

Before any contribution, read and be prepared to adhere to our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/libretime/organization/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

In addition, LibreTime follow the standardized
[C4 development process](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/c4/), in which you can
find explanation about most of the development workflows for LibreTime.

## Contribute financially

LibreTime is run by volunteers who manage the project in their spare time. Financial contributions help us pay for our domain and infrastructure. It can also be used to cover the costs of development for important features and conference attendance. If you wish to contribute financially, you can do so through our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/libretime).

## Write documentation

One of the simplest ways to get started contributing to a project is through improving documentation. LibreTime is constantly evolving, this means that sometimes our documentation has gaps. You can help by adding missing sections, editing the existing content so it is more accessible or creating new content (tutorials, FAQs, etc).

Issues pertaining to the documentation are usually marked with the [documentation](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22is%3A+documentation%22) label.

## Translate LibreTime

LibreTime can run in over 15 different languages due to the gracious help of our volunteers.

LibreTime is localized using [Weblate](https://weblate.org/). If you would like to contribute a language translation, create an account and start working on [our Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/libretime/).
