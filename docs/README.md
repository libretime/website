## History

LibreTime is a fork of AirTime due to stalled development of the open source version. For background on this, see this [open letter to the Airtime community](https://gist.github.com/hairmare/8c03b69c9accc90cfe31fd7e77c3b07d).

Airtime itself was based on the software called Campcaster. You can find more information about the [early days of Campcaster and Airtime in the repository](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/blob/main/LEGACY.md).
