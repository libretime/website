## Financial

LibreTime is run by volunteers who write code and manage the project in their
spare time. Financial contributions help us pay for our domain and back-end
infrastructure. It can also be used to cover the costs of development for
important features and conference attendance. If you wish to contribute
financially, you can do so through our
[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/libretime).

## Translation

LibreTime can run in over 15 different languages due to the gracious help of our volunteers.

Libretime is now localized using [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/). If you would like to contribute a language translation, create an account and start working on [our Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/libretime/).

## Write documentation

One of the simplest ways to get started contributing to a project is through
improving documentation. LibreTime is constantly evolving, this means that
sometimes our documentation has gaps. You can help by adding missing sections,
editing the existing content so it is more accessible or creating new content
(tutorials, FAQs, etc).

Issues pertaining to the documentation are usually marked with the [Documentation](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/labels/documentation)
label.
