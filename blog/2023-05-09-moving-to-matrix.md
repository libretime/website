Since late 2019, LibreTime has hosted our own Mattermost instance at
https://chat.libretime.org. It has been used for project planning and some
support requests. However, we want to make interacting with the project easy and
not require yet another account, so we are moving to Matrix! The new community
is available at [#libretime:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#libretime:matrix.org).

<!--truncate-->

Mattermost is a very good open source platform for communication within an
organisation, but it requires users to create an account specific for LibreTime.
This is not ideal. It also requires us to maintain the instance and manage all
the data therein.

Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. There is a
reference server provided by matrix.org that can be accessed from
https://app.element.io, but people can also host their own homeserver and use
that to interact. Conversations are split between rooms in one or more spaces. A
space acts like an index for related rooms. We have a space
(#libretime:matrix.org) with two rooms: General (#libretime-general:matrix.org)
and Support (#libretime-support:matrix.org). Any support queries should use the
Support room.

## Connecting to LibreTime Matrix rooms

1. Create an account at https://app.element.io (if you don't have a Matrix
   account already)
2. Search for #libretime:matrix.org or open
   https://matrix.to/#/#libretime:matrix.org.
3. Join the Space and select the rooms you wish to join

## Accessing the past Mattermost chat data

The chat logs for all public channels is available on the
[forum](https://discourse.libretime.org/c/logged-in-lounge/8). These are only
available for users with an account with at least [trust level
1](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/).
