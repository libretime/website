# Releases

:::note

:sparkles: New LibreTime versions are released when it's ready :tm:.

:::

## Versioning schema

We follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standards.

In a nutshell, given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Distributions releases support

New releases target the current stable distributions release, and development should prepare for future stable distributions releases.

- We recommend installing LibreTime on the current stable distributions.
- We don't provide maintenance releases for old stable distributions.
