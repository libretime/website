title: LibreTime API usage
---

:::info

We're in the process of rewriting LibreTime's API. This page contains the instructions for the current version, written in PHP.

:::

The LibreTime API enables many types of information about the broadcast schedule and configuration to be retrieved from the LibreTime server. Other than the live-info and week-info data fetched by website widgets (see the chapter _Exporting the schedule_), all API requests must be authenticated using the secret API key stored in the file `/etc/libretime/api_client.cfg` on the LibreTime server. This key is autogenerated during LibreTime installation and should be unique for each server.

If you intend to use the LibreTime API across a public network, for security reasons it is highly recommended that all API requests are sent over encrypted https: and that the web server is configured to accept requests to the api/ directory from specific host names or IP addresses only.

The format of API requests is:

```
https://libretime.example.com/api/api-action/format/json/api_key/XXXXXX
```

where api-action is the type of request and XXXXXX is the secret API key. Available actions include:

- on-air-light - return true if the station is on air
- status - get the status of LibreTime components and resource usage
- version - returns the version of LibreTime installed
- get-files-without-silan-value - list files for which silence detection has not yet been performed
- get-stream-setting - gets the settings of LibreTime output streams
- get-stream-parameters - gets the parameters of LibreTime output streams

For example, using the action _get-stream-setting_ returns the following output for the first configured stream:

```json
{"keyname":"s1_type","value":"ogg","type":"string"},

{"keyname":"s1_host","value":"streaming.example.com","type":"string"},

{"keyname":"s1_port","value":"8000","type":"integer"},

{"keyname":"s1_mount","value":"main","type":"string"},

{"keyname":"s1_url","value":"http:\/\/airtime.sourcefabric.org","type":"string"},

{"keyname":"s1_description","value":"Airtime Radio! Stream #1","type":"string"},

{"keyname":"s1_genre","value":"Screamo","type":"string"},
```

which is enough information to construct a player widget dynamically. (s1_url is the station's homepage, not the stream URL). The same information is provided with an s2\_ prefix for the second stream, and s3\_ prefix for the third stream.

Some API requests require the directory ID number to be specified as _dir_id_ including:

- list-all-files - list files in the specified directory
- get-files-without-replay-gain - list files in the specified directory for which ReplayGain has not been calculated yet

For example, using a request such as:

```
http://libretime.example.com/api/list-all-files/format/json/api_key/XXXXXX/dir_id/1/
```

returns the full path to each media file in the LibreTime storage directory:

```json
{
  "files": [
    "imported/1/Mark Ronson feat. Saigon/Here Comes the Fuzz/7-Diduntdidunt-unknown.flac",
    "imported/1/Jimi Tenor & Tony Allen/Inspiration Information/3-Selfish Gene-128kbps.mp3"
  ]
}
```
