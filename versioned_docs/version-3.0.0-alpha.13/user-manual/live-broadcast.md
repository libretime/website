## MIXXX

[Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org) is a cross-platform Open Source application for DJs.

Installed on a desktop or laptop computer, Mixxx complements your LibreTime server to provide a complete system
for both live and scheduled broadcasting. Although Mixxx has many features designed for dance music DJs
that require beat matching and pitch independent time stretching, the program can be used for any kind of
manually triggered broadcast playout, including live speech shows such as news or current affairs.

Mixxx supports a wide variety of popular hardware control surfaces, which can be connected to your
computer using a USB cable. A control surface might replace or augment an analogue mixer in your studio,
depending on your live mixing and playout requirements.

Mixxx 1.9.0 or later includes a live streaming client which, like LibreTime, is compatible with the Icecast
and SHOUTcast media servers. This feature can also be used to stream from Mixxx directly into LibreTime,
using either the **Show Source** or **Master Source**.

To configure Mixxx for streaming into LibreTime, click **Options**, **Preferences**, then
**Live Broadcasting** on the main Mixxx menu. For server **Type**, select the default of **Icecast 2**.
For **Host**, **Mount**, **Port**, **Login** and **Password**, use the **Input Stream Settings**
configured in the LibreTime **Streams** page, on LibreTime's **System** menu.
