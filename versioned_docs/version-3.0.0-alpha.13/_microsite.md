![](/img/radio-page.png)

LibreTime includes a microsite, which can be accessed at _serverIP_ or a domain you've set up for your server. The site includes your
logo and station description (set under Settings > General), the login button to the LibreTime interface, the schedule for the next seven days,
podcast tabs, and a live feed of your station with information on the currently playing artist and track.

## Modifying the LibreTime radio page

The background of the mini-site that appears when you visit the server's domain in your web browser can be changed by modifying the page's CSS file, located at `/usr/share/airtime/php/legacy/public/css/radio-page/radio-page.css`.

```css
html {
  background: url("img/background-testing-3.jpg") no-repeat center center fixed;
  -webkit-background-size: cover;
  -moz-background-size: cover;
  -o-background-size: cover;
  background-size: cover;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

Place the new background image in the `/usr/share/airtime/php/legacy/public/css/radio-page/img/` folder and change the `background:` entry's URL to point to the new image. The new image should be at least 1280 x 720 in pixel size to avoid being blurry.
